# Telewise

Telewise is a movie and TV guide powered by the [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API. 

The purpose of this repository is to help me keep up with the latest (and greatest?) tools available
 in Android development. Another repository ([Filmipedia](https://github.com/Aayushjn/Filmipedia)) 
 exists but the amount of refactoring required would not be worth it. Instead, I can start from the 
 ground up in a new repository.
